Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

 ** # This is an <h1> tag **
 ** ## This is an <h2> tag **
 ** ## this is an <h3> tag **
** ###### This is an <h6> tag **

```*This text will be italic* : if you add one star on each side.```
```_This will also be italic_:  if you add one underscore on each side.```
```**This text will be bold**: if you add two stars on each side.```

```__This will also be bold__ : if you add two underscores on each side.```

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |.
