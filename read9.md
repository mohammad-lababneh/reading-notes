## Choosing A Text Editor
 choosing a text editor
ends up being a very personal choice. If you want to search on google for the best the best test editor , GOOGLE definitely will tell you I think the best text editor is truly the one that you enjoy using the most. 

## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. ```The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.```

## What features should you look for in a text editor?
 I would say some of the most important features are:
  **1.) code completion**
  **2.) syntax highlighting;**
** 3.) a nice variety of themes**
 
 
#### what is cod completion ?
 Allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. 

 #### what is syntax highlighting ?
  Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

 #### what is nice series of themes?
  These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor.

 ## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer.
Every computer will come with its own text editor.
 **On Mac computers**, the text editor that comes is 
**Text Edit** 
On **Windows computers**, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, **Notepad**.
 On **Linux computers**, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution. These text editors will go by **different names**.


## There are alot of software like : 
**Notepad++**
**Text Wrangler**
**BB Edit**
**Visual Studio Code**
**Atom**
**Brackets**
** Sublime Text**
These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites.
 Each of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are widely used in web development today.

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs.
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
