### How the Web works
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basic structural element that is used to create webpages. HTML is a markup language, which means that it is used to “mark up” the content within a document, in this case a webpage, with structural and semantic information that tells a browser how to display a page.


### State and Props work
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states. Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data. … State data can be modified by its own component, but is private (cannot be accessed from outside) Props can only be passed from parent component to child (unidirectional flow) Modifying state should happen with the setState ( ) method




### **Tools and methods**
`A work management system to track items in progress.`
`A shared document system to make sure everyone including your client has access to important project documents and information.`
`A communication tool like email or Slack so that the teams can stay in touch about any questions or needs that emerge.`



## **Hybrid Flow**
Applications that are able to securely store Client Secrets may benefit from the use of the Hybrid Flow `(defined in section 3.3 of the OIDC spec)`, which allows your application to have immediate access to an ID token while still providing for secure and safe retrieval of access and refresh tokens. This can be useful in situations where your application needs to immediately access information about the user, but must perform some processing before gaining access to protected resources for an extended period of time.



#### What Is Node.js Used For?
Maybe you are a Node.js developer, JavaScript community veteran, passionate supporter, or generally into modern software development. Or perhaps you want to learn how to be more productive with various tools that successful Node.js professionals are using. Either way, you’ve come to the right place.

In this blog series, we will go over the most important categories of tools that are closely related to all aspects of successful nodestering—from development environments, frameworks, and test and build tools to continuous integration, delivery, and monitoring. So, without further ado, let’s start our journey through the world of Node.js tools.

Disclaimer:  You will probably notice that the tools showcased are a bit pro-backend or DevOps-oriented. I apologize for that, but keep in mind that many of the tools and their applications go beyond just backend/frontend/desktop/mobile: Their purpose is to build good quality software in general.
