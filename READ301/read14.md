## When are diversity efforts most successful?Links to an external site.
When they come from the top of an organization! If the leaders are 100% committed to the efforts, it is likely that is will become a part of company cultre.



## diversity in tech company
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts. Here are five themes that have emerged from those conversations:

U.S. Census Bureau numbers show overall U.S. Black and Latinx/Hispanic populations at 13.4% and 18.5%, respectively. “We’ve seen a lot of reasonable pressure on tech companies around [diversity, equity and inclusion] lately,” said Meredith Benton, a consultant with As You Sow and principal at Whistle Stop Capital. But tech companies are still lagging when it comes to diversity and inclusion. … According to the available data from 10 major U.S. tech companies gathered between 2014 and 2019, the percentage of women in these workforces increased less than 2%.


## Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
