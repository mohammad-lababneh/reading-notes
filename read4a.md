# JAVASCRIPT 
*In these pages, the author show how the HTML, CSS, and JAVA are fit together. *
Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on content. Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. The JavaScript is added last
and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.

Creating a basic JAVASCRIPT, It is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script.
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon ** ; **.

Statements are instructions that the computer should follow. Each statement should start on a
new line and end with a semicolon. 
You should write comments to explain what your code does. Using single line comment ** // ** and multi-line comment ** /* ** . They help make your code easier to read and understand.

What is a variable?
The variable use to store value, and this value can change on each time the script run.
